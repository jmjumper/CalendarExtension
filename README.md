# Calendar Extension

Add events to your calendar app while browsing.  <br>
Just select the text to be used as the event title, open the extension and you are almost done.

## Implementation to your calendar app
The url as seen in the left image can be subscribed to in most calendar-providers such as Apple Calendar or Google Calendar etc. <br>
### In <b>Apple Calendar</b>: 
Open Calendar-app -> click on "Calendars" at the bottom -> "Add Calendar" -> "Add Subscription Calendar" -> insert <b>your</b> URL
### In <b>Google Calendar</b>:
At "Other calendars", click on the "+" -> "Subscribe to calendar" -> "From URL" -> insert <b>your</b> URL  <br>
### Others:
Other providers will not differ significantly from Apple/Google.

## Synchronisation 
You can synchronise the extension between different browsers by using the same user-id in the settings. This is self-explanatory. <br>
This may also be used to restore calendars.

It may not be pretty but functional.
