## Implementation to calendar app
The url as seen in the left image can be subscribed to in most calendar-providers such as Apple Calendar or Google Calendar etc. <br>
### In <b>Apple Calendar</b>: 
Open Calendar-app -> click on "Calendars" at the bottom -> "Add Calendar" -> "Add Subscription Calendar" -> insert <b>your</b> URL
### In <b>Google Calendar</b>:
At "Other calendars", click on the "+" -> "Subscribe to calendar" -> "From URL" -> insert <b>your</b> URL  <br>
### Others:
Other providers will not differ significantly from Apple/Google.

It may not be pretty but functional.
